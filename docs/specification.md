## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this software is to recommend films to users based on a textual description they provide. The system will return a random film from a dataset.

### 1.2 Scope
This system is designed for movie enthusiasts who want to find films based on thematic elements, mood, or story elements rather than specific titles. The software will:
- Accept a textual description from the user.
- Return a random film from an IMDb-based database.

The system will be implemented as a web-based application with a backend for processing and storage. Future extensions may include film suggestion based on description keywords.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **IMDb**: Internet Movie Database, a comprehensive dataset of films and related metadata.

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Product Perspective
This software is an independent application utilizing a dataset sourced from IMDb. It integrates with a user-friendly interface for input and output. 

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Accepts user input in the form of a natural language text description.
- Extracts keywords from the input.
- Queries an IMDb-based dataset to find films with matching keywords.
- Returns a ranked list of the k most relevant films.
- Allows users to refine results by adjusting search parameters.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **Casual Users**: Users who wish to find movies based on descriptions but have limited technical knowledge.
- **Film Enthusiasts**: Users who explore films based on thematic elements and recommendations.

### 2.4 Constraints
- The reccomendation lacks of accuracy.
- The system should support various languages, but the primary focus will be English.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The dataset used for recommendations will be regularly updated.
- The system will require a stable internet connection for database queries.

## 3. Specific Requirements
