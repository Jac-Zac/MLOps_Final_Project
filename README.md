# MLops Final Project

## Idea

From a [movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashkotal/imbd-top-1000-with-description) and a user description, we return Movies !

So the idea is to use RAG to get k-most relevant movies descriptions and then we return them and order them by rating.

Moreover we can filter them by some other feature.

We can also have a way in the interface to change the number k of movies.

## Talk about issues or extensions

Already seen movies etc ...

#### To tackle this semi limitation

We want to show other films that do not include those ones. So we can get the k+1 system
