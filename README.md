# MLops Final Project

## Idea

From a movie dataset and a user description, we return Movies !

**Possible datasets:**

- [1k movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashkotal/imbd-top-1000-with-description)
- [10k movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset)

So the idea is to use RAG to get k-most relevant movies descriptions and then we return them and order them by rating.

Moreover we can filter them by some other feature.

We can also have a way in the interface to change the number k of movies.

## Talk about issues or extensions

Already seen movies etc ...

#### To tackle this semi limitation

We want to show other films that do not include those ones. So we can get the k+1 system
